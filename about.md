I am not from a Math Background & Math Crypto is quite difficult for me. On a lot of topics, I am unable to find a single text or source which  explains the topic in enough detail for me to understand & I have to go looking through a lot of sources, ask questions on forums etc to understand the topic. I mostly blog here to collate all the information on such topics at one place.  

- This blog is built on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)   

- I do not use Ruby & other tools locally to build it. Forked from [Jekyll Now](https://www.jekyllnow.com/) so everything can be done online.

- I use [Mathjax](https://www.mathjax.org/). Here are the [instructions](http://sgeos.github.io/github/jekyll/2016/08/21/adding_mathjax_to_a_jekyll_github_pages_blog.html) to integrate it into Github pages.

- I use [Utterances](https://utteranc.es/) for comments.   

- Social Media share templates are based on [this](https://sourabhbajaj.com/blog/2017/10/29/adding-social-media-share-icons-to-jekyll/).

Certainly! Let's list the elements of both quotient rings: 

$x + 1$

$\mathbb{F}_2[x]/\langle x^3 - 1 \rangle$ and $\mathbb{F}_2[x]/\langle x^3 + x + 1 \rangle$. 

Both rings consist of all polynomials of degree less than 3 with coefficients in $\mathbb{F}_2 = \{0, 1\}$, but their multiplication rules differ due to the different quotient relations.

---

### **1. Quotient Ring $\mathbb{F}_2[x]/\langle x^3 - 1 \rangle$**
Here, $x^3 = 1$ (since we're quotienting by $x^3 - 1 = 0$).  
The elements are all polynomials of the form $a + b x + c x^2$, where $a, b, c \in \mathbb{F}_2$.  
This gives $2^3 = 8$ distinct elements:

$$\[
\begin{align*}
0 &= 0 \\
1 &= 1 \\
x &= x \\
x^2 &= x^2 \\
1 + x &= 1 + x \\
1 + x^2 &= 1 + x^2 \\
x + x^2 &= x + x^2 \\
1 + x + x^2 &= 1 + x + x^2 \\
\end{align*}
\]$$

**Multiplication rules:**  
Since $x^3 = 1$, higher powers reduce as follows:
- $x^4 = x \cdot x^3 = x \cdot 1 = x$,
- $x^5 = x^2 \cdot x^3 = x^2 \cdot 1 = x^2$,
- etc.

This ring is **not a field** because $x^3 - 1$ is reducible ($x^3 - 1 = (x - 1)(x^2 + x + 1)$), leading to zero divisors:
- $(x - 1)(x^2 + x + 1) = 0$ in the quotient.

### **2. Quotient Ring $\mathbb{F}_2[x]/\langle x^3 + x + 1 \rangle$**
Here, $x^3 = x + 1$ (since we're quotienting by $x^3 + x + 1 = 0$).  
Again, the elements are all polynomials $a + b x + c x^2$, where $a, b, c \in \mathbb{F}_2$, giving the same 8 elements as above:

\[
\begin{align*}
0 &= 0 \\
1 &= 1 \\
x &= x \\
x^2 &= x^2 \\
1 + x &= 1 + x \\
1 + x^2 &= 1 + x^2 \\
x + x^2 &= x + x^2 \\
1 + x + x^2 &= 1 + x + x^2 \\
\end{align*}
\]

**Multiplication rules:**  
Now, $x^3 = x + 1$, and higher powers reduce as:
- $x^4 = x \cdot x^3 = x(x + 1) = x^2 + x$,
- $x^5 = x \cdot x^4 = x(x^2 + x) = x^3 + x^2 = (x + 1) + x^2 = x^2 + x + 1$,
- etc.

This ring **is a field** (the finite field $\mathbb{F}_8$) because $x^3 + x + 1$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{F}_2$. Thus, every nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse.

---

### **Key Differences**
- Both rings have the same additive structure (8 elements, addition works the same way).
- **Multiplication is different**:
  - In $\mathbb{F}_2[x]/\langle x^3 - 1 \rangle$, $x^3 = 1$, and there are zero divisors (e.g., $(x + 1)(x^2 + x + 1) = 0$).
  - In $\mathbb{F}_2[x]/\langle x^3 + x + 1 \rangle$, $x^3 = x + 1$, and all nonzero elements are invertible (it's a field).

### **Example of Different Multiplicative Behavior**
- **In $\mathbb{F}_2[x]/\langle x^3 - 1 \rangle$:**
  - $x \cdot x^2 = x^3 = 1$.
  - $x \cdot (1 + x + x^2) = x + x^2 + x^3 = x + x^2 + 1$.
- **In $\mathbb{F}_2[x]/\langle x^3 + x + 1 \rangle$:**
  - $x \cdot x^2 = x^3 = x + 1$ (not 1!).
  - $x \cdot (1 + x + x^2) = x + x^2 + x^3 = x + x^2 + (x + 1) = x^2 + 1$.

Thus, while the elements "look the same," their algebraic structure differs due to the different quotient relations. The first is a **ring with zero divisors**, while the second is a **field**.
